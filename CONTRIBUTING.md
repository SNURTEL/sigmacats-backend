# Contributing

Task workflow:

1. Grab a task from the [issue board](https://github.com/users/SNURTEL/projects/1/views/1), assign it to yourself and
   move to "In Progress"
2. Create a branch using the following schema: `feature/<GitHub issue number>/<Issue name>` and link it with the issue:
    - Tip: Go to issue page and press "Create a branch" to create a linked branch
    - ![link_branch.png](.img/link_branch.png)

3. Do your work, commit & push changes
4. Run tests and static / dynamic analysis (if applicable). Merging the branch will be blocked if any CI pipeline fails!
5. Create a pull request and merge it. Asking someone to review it is highly recommended! :)
